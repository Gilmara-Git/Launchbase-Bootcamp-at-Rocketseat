## About
This was a project about building a Gym System Management.

## Learnings
- It was developed during the LaunchBase Bootcamp along with our instructor Mayk Brito. 
- At first, the Front-end for ***Instructors*** and ***Members*** were created.
- FORMs for both resources were created, so, resources can be created, saved and edited.
 - **http** methods GET, POST, PUT and DELETE were used.

- Then, PostgreSQL was installed and configured to replace the **data.json** file. 
- In this final phase, filters were applied to bring specific data from DB.
Also, **pagination** was implemented based on the total number of records returned from DATABASE. In order to do that, 
created a sub-query to return the total number of records for both **instructors** and **members**. Then used this information to calculate the number of pages there will be.
- The "first" and "last" pages are always displayed on the screen. Also, the "selected page", the page "before" the selected and the page "after" the selected page are display. If there are more than 2 pages in between,  (...) are shown.
