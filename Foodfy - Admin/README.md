## About
Foodfy is a project about building a Web Application for recipes.

## Objectives
- In this part of the project I built the **Admin area** where the end user will create new recipes, as well as update and delete them. For these features HTTP methods, GET, POST, PUT and DELETE were used. 
- Learned how to create new dynamic EMPTY fields for INGREDIENTS AND PREPARATION, so more data can be inserted into the recipe information upon creating and updating a recipe.
- I got rid of the "data.js" file and replaced it with "data.json" file. Therefore, both the website and the Admin area are consuming data from the same source.  

## Languages used
- Html5 (Hypertext)
- Css3 (Cascading Style Sheet)
- Javascript

## Code information
As the bootcamp progresses, more codes will be uploaded here.
Done so far:
 The webpages and the Admin area
