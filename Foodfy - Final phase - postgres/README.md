## About
Foodfy was a project about building a Web Application for recipes.

## Learning Objectives
- This was the final part of the project in which **chefs** pages were created in the **Admin** area. 
So, now in addition to recipes, chefs can be created, edited and deleted **when** there is no **recipe** tied to it. 
- **Filters** to search for recipes and chefs were added.
Also, pagination was added to the recipes's page. 
- Postgres database is being used to store persistently.


## Languages used
- Html5 (Hypertext)
- Css3 (Cascading Style Sheet)
- Javascript
- Postgres
