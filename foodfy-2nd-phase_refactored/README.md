## About
Foodfy is a project about building a Web Application for recipes.

## Objectives
In this part of the project I **refactored Foodfy code** by creating a data.js to store data for recipes, and then pulled this data into pages "Index","Recipes" and "Recipe details".
I got rid of the modal which displayed recipe's more information and replaced it with and new entire page above showing details of ingredients, preparation and additional information.  

## Languages used
- Html5 (Hypertext)
- Css3 (Cascading Style Sheet)
- Javascript

## Code information
As the bootcamp progresses, more codes will be uploaded here.
Done so far:
 - Pages Index, About and Recipes were create.
 - Each recipe opens individually in a Modal-Overlay
