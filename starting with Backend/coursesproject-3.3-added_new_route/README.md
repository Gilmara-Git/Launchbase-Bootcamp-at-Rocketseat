## About
This project was part of Rockeseat's bootcamp process in which a webpage was built to show some of the courses Rocketseat provides.  

## Objectives
The objectives involved exploring not only creating the page, but also create a server using technologies such as npm, express, nodemon and nunjucks as a template engine criteria.
