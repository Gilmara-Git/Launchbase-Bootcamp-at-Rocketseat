## About - Step 4.7
This is a project is about building a Web Application - Teachers and Students.

## Learning Objectives
- Created the Students’ page by re-using the structure of Teachers’ page including routes for HTTP methods GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. 

- Re-organized files structure/folders 

- Created an array on the data.json file for students’ data. 

- Created a Js script to control which link will be active based on the user’s navigation. (For that location.pathname was used and method includes() were used). 

 - Created a NEW button on Teachers and Students Index page. 

- Adjusted the form for Students’ creation (added and removed some fields) 

- Adjusted route POST to get the correct elements from req.body, have them written on data.json FILE. 

- Implemented a logic for students’ id and teacher's id, so "id" will not repeat on data.json file. 

- Adjusted function “date” to return an object type iso, then used it to display birthday as day/month on page show. 

- Created function grade to return students grade and display on page SHOW and INDEX.  

- In order to confirm resource deletion (teachers or students) created a separate “njk” file with a script (included it on "Students", "Teachers"EDIT pages). If user does not confirm deletion, method event preventDefaulf is goind to cancel the deletion Event. 

Finally, adjusted the new fields for the index Students’ page to display the new fields, email and grade and tested creation and deletion features. 

 
## Languages / Technologies used
- Html5 (Hypertext)

## Code information
As the bootcamp progresses, more codes will be uploaded.

Done so far:  
- Along the way we have created the Teachers and Students' page and its routes, using HTTP method such as GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. 
- Modified teacher's and student's index page to display data into a TABLE.
