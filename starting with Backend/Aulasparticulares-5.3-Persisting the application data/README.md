## About - Step 5.3 - PostgreSQL
This is a project is about building a Web Application - Teachers and Students.

## Learnings
- Created a relationship between tables **teachers** and **students** by adding the field **teacher_id** on the **students** table.
- Added a SELECT field on the student creation/edit pages called **My Teachers** , so students can select and edit their teacher. Then, in order to populated this field, created a function to bring teachers' **name** and **id** from the database. Adjusted functions, **create** and **update** to properly write this new information on the database.  
- Created a field called **Students** to display the total students for each teacher.
- Implemented a **form** and **filter** button on the teachers' index page that filters **teachers** or **subjects** by the characters typed in the input field.

## Languages / Technologies used
- Html5 (Hypertext)
- Css3 (Cascading Style Sheet)
- Javascript
- Node.js
- PostgreSQL
- Postbird

## Code information
As the bootcamp progresses, more codes will be uploaded.
Done so far:  
- Along the way I have created the Teachers and Students' page and its routes, using HTTP method such as GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. 
- Created "my_teachers" database, teachers and students' table to store the application data.
 - Created a relationship between **teachers** and **students** tables and used SQL queries to display the students' names in ASCENDING order and to display the total number of Students thar are linked to a Teacher. 
- Finally, created a filter to on the Teachers page, so user can search by teacher or subjects.
