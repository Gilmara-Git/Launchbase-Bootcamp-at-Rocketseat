## About - Step 5.1 - PostgreSQL
This is a project is about building a Web Application - Teachers and Students.

## Learning objectives 
- Installed postgreSQL + postbird.
- Learned how to "start" and "stop" postgreSQL.
- Learned how to connect postbird to postgreSQL.
- Created database "my_teachers" and table "teachers". (See image)
- Got rid of the data.json file once I will be using the database from now on.
- Refactored some code and folder's structures.  
- Created connection to "db" using "Pool", so I will be allowed to run queries to "db" without having re-authenticate.
 
## Languages / Technologies used
- Html5 (Hypertext)
- Css3 (Cascading Style Sheet)
- Javascript
- Node.js
- PostgreSQL
- Postbird

## Code information
As the bootcamp progresses, more codes will be uploaded.

Done so far:  
- Along the way we have created the Teachers and Students' page and its routes, using HTTP method such as GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. 
- Initiated Database learning objectives.
