## About - Step 5.4 (last)- Pagination on Teachers and Students pages
This was a project about building a Web Application - Teachers and Students.

## Learnings
- Implemented the **pagination** logic based on the total number of records returned from DATABASE. In order to do that, 
created a sub-query to return the total number of records for both teachers and students. Then used this information to calculate the number of pages there will be.
- The "first", "second", "before last" and "last" pages are always displayed on the screen. Also, the "selected page", page "before" the selected and page "after" the selected page are display. If there are more than 2 pages in between,  (...) are shown.
